# Mind Game - Memory Card Game

This is a simple memory card game built using Angular (version 19.2.0) and PrimeNG (version 19.0.10). The game offers three different difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Players are required to match pairs of cards within a certain number of attempts.

## Game Overview

The objective of the game is to find pairs of matching cards. Depending on the difficulty level, the player will need to select a specific number of pairs:

- **Easy Level:** Select a pair of 8 cards (4 pairs).
- **Medium Level:** Select a pair of 12 cards (6 pairs).
- **Hard Level:** Select a pair of 16 cards (8 pairs).
